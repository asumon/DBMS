# Lesson 2: Practical Database Usage

In this class, students will learn how to use more complex SQL queries to retrieve information across tables, and interact with data including write operations.

Objective: Students should be able to build CRUD functionality using SQL statements, including INSERT INTO, UPDATE and DELETE.

## Homework

- Write the necessary SQL statements to complete the functionality of the node task application. This includes, at the minimum, the following functionality:
    - Adding a new task
    - Changing the title, due date, or status of a task
    - Marking a task as completed
    - Deleting a task
    - Deleting a user
- Create a new database containing the following tables:
    - **Class**: with the columns: id, name, begins (date), ends (date)
    - **Student**: with the columns: id, name, email, phone, class_id (foreign key)
- If you are done with the above tasks, you can continue with these advanced tasks:
    - Create an index on the name column of the student table.
    - Add a new column to the class table named **status** which can only have the following values: not-started, ongoing, finished (hint: enumerations).
